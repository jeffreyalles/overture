/**
    Object: O.ViewEventsController

    Most DOM events are handled via delegation. When an event occurs, it is
    passed to the O.ViewEventsController. This maintains a list of event
    targets that should receive the event before the view handles it, and a list
    of targets that should receive it after it has traversed the view hierarchy.

    When an event is dispatched, it passes through all targets in the first
    list, then is dispatched at the view which owns the node on which the event
    occurred (and will bubble up the view tree from there), then passes through
    all the targets that are queued to handle it after the view. Any event
    handler may call `event.stopPropagation()`, which will stop the view from
    passing to any further targets.

    Standard event target priorities used in library:

    40  - MouseEventRemover
    30  - gestureManager
    20  - DragController
    15  - MenuFilterView
    10  - ModalViewHandler
    -10 - GlobalKeyboardShortcuts

    /**
        Method: O.ViewEventsController#addEventTarget

        Adds an event target to queue to receive view events. The position in
        the queue is determined by the priority argument:

        * Greater than 0 => before the view hierarchy receives the event.
        * Less than 0 => after the view hierarchy receives the event.

        If an existing target in the queue has the same priority as the new one,
        the new one will be inserted such that it fires before the old one.

        Parameters:
            eventTarget - {O.EventTarget} The event target to add.
            priority    - {Number} The priority of the event target.

        Returns:
            {O.ViewEventsController} Returns self.
