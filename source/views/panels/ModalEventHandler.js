    // could mousedown and drag their mouse out of the window before releasing
    // it or vica versa. If there is a drag in between mousedown and mouseup,
    // the click event won't fire).

    // The safest to hide on is click, as we know there are no more events from
    // this user interaction which we need to capture, and it also means the
    // user has clicked and released outside the pop over; a decent indication
    // we should close it. However, if the pop over was triggered on mousedown
    // we may still see a mouseup and a click event from this initial user
    // interaction, but these must not hide the view. Therefore, we make sure
    // we've seen at least one mousedown event after the popOver view shows
    // before hiding on click. On Android/iOS, we will not see a mousedown
    // event, so we also count a touchstart event.
