/**
    Class: O.Animation

    At its core, O.Animation just repeatedly calls a method,
    <O.Animation#drawFrame>, over a given time period, supplying it with a
    number between 0 and 1 to tell it how far through the animation it currently
    is. This number is modified according to the easing function specified.

    The default implementation will set a numeric property on an object,
    interpolating between the initial value of the property and the value it's
    asked to transition to. If this is what you want to do, simply initialise
    your O.Animation instance with an "object" and a "property" value.

    For animating something other than a numeric property, override
    <O.Animation#prepare> and <O.Animation#drawFrame> methods.
