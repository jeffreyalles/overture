/**
    Function: O.Easing.cubicBezier

    Returns an easing function that, for the given cubic bezier control
    points, returns the y position given an x position. p0 is presumed to
    be (0,0) and p3 is presumed to be (1,1).

    Parameters:
        p1x - {Number} The x-coordinate for point 1.
        p1y - {Number} The y-coordinate for point 1.
        p2x - {Number} The x-coordinate for point 2.
        p2y - {Number} The y-coordinate for point 2.

    Returns:
        {Function} A function representing the cubic bezier with the points
        given, with an equivalent CSS representation on the function's cssName
        property.
